# Infomarket-Visual-Studio-CSharp
 Infomarket is a project created in Visual Studio with the C # language and connected to the DB with SQLServer. This is my first project, and I did it in the second semester of college.
    Infomarket is a program in which you can register customers, products and orders, change them or delete them. The program features are:

- Register / Browse / Update / Delete Manufacturers
